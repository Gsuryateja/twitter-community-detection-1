#### writeup
Temporal snapshot - 1 million tweets harvest over 3 days in the NYC
Area

Alteratives: could create an ego-centric graph based around an
individual and grab all of their tweets. Then for each of their
followers, grab all of their tweets too. This quickly becomes
exponentially large - Twitter launched in 2006, some users have
millions of tweets and millions of followers. 

Future work: could expand to outside of the NYC geographically, either
constainted to the united states or wrld wide. This may be some
interesting future work - does clustering and information diffusion
differ from stat to state or nation to nation? 

The data that was collected constructed a large number of
subgraphs. See (TODO add a table with the above data) and (TODO see
images for 10/100/1000 tweets). After around 100k tweets, the number
of users (nodes) and edges (retweet/mention relationship) begins to
saturated. At 1 million tweets the number of nodes, edges, component
subgraphs and largest subgraph are about the same as at 1 million
tweets. This leads me to believe that 100k tweets manages to capture
all of the regular tweeters. 

Spectral Clustering does not work as expected if the graph is not
connected.
